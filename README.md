# File I/O in Java: Writing and Reading Notes

This project demonstrates how to use Java's `FileWriter` and `BufferedReader` (or `FileReader`) to write data to a file and read it back.

## Overview

In this project, you will find two Java classes:
1. `FileWriteExample.java`: This class writes a set of sample notes to a file called `notes.txt` using `FileWriter`.
2. `FileReadExample.java`: This class reads the notes from `notes.txt` using `BufferedReader` and prints them to the console.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed (version 8 or higher).
- A terminal/command line environment to compile and run the Java files.

## Files

- `FileWriteExample.java`: Writes sample notes to `notes.txt`.
- `FileReadExample.java`: Reads and prints the content of `notes.txt`.
- `notes.txt` (Optional): This file is created when you run `FileWriteExample.java`. You don't need to create it manually.
